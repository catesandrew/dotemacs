; "After" macro definition
;
; http://www.lunaryorn.com/2013/06/25/introducing-with-eval-after-load.html
;
; At June, 13th Emacs trunk introduced a new macro `with-eval-after-load`. It
; behaves like `eval-after-load`, except that it takes multiple unquoted forms
; and wraps them into a lambda to enable byte compilation:
;
; This supersedes much of my last post about byte compilation in
; `eval-after-load`. However, the new macro does not load the corresponding
; features during byte compilation, so Iâ€™ll wrap my old `after` macro
; around it to avoid bogus warnings:
(defmacro after (feature &rest forms)
  "After FEATURE is loaded, evaluate FORMS.

FORMS is byte compiled.

FEATURE may be a named feature or a file name, see
`with-eval-after-load' for details."
  (declare (indent 1) (debug t))
  `(,(if (or (not byte-compile-current-file)
             (if (symbolp feature)
                 (require feature nil :no-error)
               (load feature :no-message :no-error)))
         'progn
       (message "after: cannot find %s" feature)
       'with-no-warnings)
    (with-eval-after-load ',feature ,@forms)))
